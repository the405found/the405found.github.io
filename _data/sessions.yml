  title: "Panel: Leveling Up Our Tech Career"
  description: 'With Greater Boston seeing <a href="https://www.bostonindicators.org/reports/report-website-pages/changing-faces-of-greater-boston/changing-faces-of-greater-boston-report" target="_blank">diversity on the rise</a> and being the <a href="https://www.americaninno.com/boston/report-boston-is-the-third-fastest-growing-tech-hub/" target="_blank">third fastest growing tech hub</a> according to a 2019 report from Indeed Hiring Lab, why does minority representation in the tech sector remain low? <p>According to <a href="https://www.masstlc.org/state-tech-economy19-dl/" target="_blank">The State of the Massachusetts Tech Economy</a> 2019 report released by the Massachusetts Technology Leadership Technology (MassTLC), about one-third of all workers are women, 5 percent of tech workers are Black, and 7 percent are Latinx. 
  
  <p>As paraphrased from social entrepreneur Leila Janah:
  
  <blockquote><center>Talent is everywhere, opportunity is not.</center></blockquote>
  
  <p>Panelists will speak about challenges they have faced to break into, advance in, and stay in tech. They will also discuss identifying, creating, and taking advantage of opportunities to reach where they are now and further enhance their career in tech.'
