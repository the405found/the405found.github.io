# About Block
aboutTitle: "About The 405 Found"
aboutEvent: "
<p> With Greater Boston seeing <a href='https://www.bostonindicators.org/reports/report-website-pages/changing-faces-of-greater-boston/changing-faces-of-greater-boston-report' target='_blank'>diversity on the rise</a> and being the <a href='https://www.americaninno.com/boston/report-boston-is-the-third-fastest-growing-tech-hub/' target='_blank'>third fastest growing tech hub</a> according to a 2019 report from Indeed Hiring Lab, why does minority representation in the tech sector remain low? 
<p> According to <a href='https://www.masstlc.org/state-tech-economy19-dl/' target='_blank'>The State of the Massachusetts Tech Economy</a> 2019 report released by the Massachusetts Technology Leadership Technology (MassTLC), about one-third of all workers are women, 5 percent of tech workers are Black, and 7 percent are Latinx. 
<p> As paraphrased from social entrepreneur Leila Janah:
<center><b><i><blockquote>Talent is everywhere, opportunity is not.</blockquote></i></b></center> 
<p> As such, <a href='https://www.codeforboston.org/' target='_blank'><b>Code for Boston</b></a> and <a href='https://hireforheart.com/' target='_blank'><b>Hire for Heart</b></a> are partnering to organize this event to gather diverse talent in the Greater Boston area and create opportunities for starting and enhancing their career in tech. <a href='https://the405found.github.io/the405found.github.io/schedule/'>Click here</a> to view our event schedule."

teamBlockEventTitle: "Why the name The 405 Found?"
teamAboutEvent: "<p>‘404 not found’ is a common HTTP response indicating that the browser requested an invalid resource, typically because the resource doesn’t exist. Less well known is ‘405 not found,' which indicates that the browser requested a valid resource using an invalid HTTP method.
<p>When applied to the context of hiring and promoting minority talent:
<ul>
  <li><b>404 not found</b> = “There isn’t enough diverse talent out there to adequately fill our tech roles.”</li>
  <li><b>405 not found</b> = “The methods, frameworks, and rubrics currently used to identify diverse candidates for hire and promotion aren’t working.</li>
  <li><b>405 found</b> = “Diverse talent is all around us when we use different methods, frameworks, and rubrics that assess people’s competencies and potential to excel in these tech roles.”</li>

We realize that this is pretty short notice so we hope you can help us spread the word! There will be pizza, prizes and a great group of geeks to spend the evening coding with! Even if you don't have an app idea come on in and lend a hand to someone else or maybe find inspiration once you're here!"}
# - {title: "Google Glass", image: "hackathon-1.png", details: "We love wearable computing especially Google Glass for which we want to gather the break up community in order to boost innovation.<br><br>Coding an app on Google Glass needs its Rockstar Dev : the team needs a fast learner with solid skills on Android. He knows his way around Android SDK, already checked the Glass Developement Kit (GDK) quick start guide allowing him to jump start developing an app for Glass.The Designer has the hard task to build the visual identity from the ground up, he has strong UX knowledge and a deep understanding of the new rules set by the Glass. His design skills give him the credibility to decide the most effective UI and the most compelling Glass experience."}
# - {title: "Polymer", image: "hackathon-2.png", details: "Polymer is a library that introduces web components. Web components are small elements on a page that can be extended and incorporated in web applications. The result is an increase in productivity.<br><br>We used Polymer mainly to explore the concept of web components. The transition of Google to material design was also a factor.While the library was never touched by the team, it still was painless to wireframe the application. Later on we incorporated some Polymer components in the design. We didn’t use the full potential of Polymer because of the limited time."}
